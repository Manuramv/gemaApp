# gemaApp

## Introduction 
This application shows the list of Users. We can search an user,filter users by Gender, Lamguage and other criterias.We know  these things are very simple and basic one,right? But the tricky part is that this application is not doing any business logic work and it serves only UI, same as what views do in MVP/MVVM. This app will just invoke the methods of [our library](https://github.com/Manuramv/gemalib) and this library perfoms the network calls, database operaions and return the processed data to the app to display to the user.
